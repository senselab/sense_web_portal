<strong>Title</strong>: The  Shapley Value: Its Use and Implications on Internet Economics<u> </u> 
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Within the current Internet,  autonomous ISPs implement bilateral agreements, with each ISP establishing  agreements that suit its own local objective to maximize its profit. Peering  agreements based on local views and bilateral settlements, while expedient,  encourage selfish routing strategies and discriminatory interconnections. From  a more global perspective, such settlements reduce aggregate profits, limit the  stability of routes, and discourage potentially useful peering/connectivity  arrangements, thereby unnecessarily balkanizing the Internet. We show that if  the distribution of profits is enforced at a global level, then there exist  profit-sharing mechanisms derived from the coalition games concept of Shapley  value and its extensions that will encourage these selfish ISPs who seek to  maximize their own profits to converge to a Nash equilibrium. We show that  these profit sharing schemes exhibit several fairness properties that support  the argument that this distribution of profits is desirable. In addition, at  the Nash equilibrium point, the routing and connecting/peering strategies  maximize aggregate network profits, encourage ISP connectivity so as to limit  balkanization.</p>

<strong>Title</strong>:&nbsp; Selected Threats and Challenges for Dependable Systems
<p> 
  <strong>Abstract</strong>:&nbsp; With the advent of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the networked devices pervade every aspect of our daily life. Therefore, we are facing more serious threats to the dependability of systems and information due to problems caused by accidental events such as human mistakes and physical malfunctions or by intentional behavior being either malicious or non-malicious. In this talk, we will discuss some example threats and challenges for systems requiring high dependability. We then give views of future directions in research on the dependability of networked systems.

<strong>Title</strong>:&nbsp;Design  of Distributed Algorithms for Engineering Applications of WSNs</p>
  <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: As technology advances,  applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been extended from  traditional habitat monitoring, air pollution monitoring, etc., to more  domain-specific engineering areas such as structural health monitoring (SHM)  and volcano tomography. However, how to implement the sophisticated models and  algorithms of these engineering applications within a resource-limited WSN  becomes the main roadblock. This task is difficult because these algorithms are  not only computationally intensive, but also involve data-level collaboration  of multiple sensors. Data-level collaboration refers to that data collected  from different sensors are tightly coupled in the computation process.In this  presentation, using some typical engineering applications such as SHM, smart  grid and volcanic tomography, I will discuss the issues and techniques of  designing distributed, light-weight version of these engineering computation  algorithms. The distributed algorithms should be able to optimize some  pre-defined performance criteria (e.g. communication cost and  time-to-completion) under severe resource constraints and various uncertainties  in the system. I will describe frameworks for decomposing some typical  sophisticated and centralized signal processing algorithms and computation  tasks within a large scale WSN with guaranteed accuracy and optimized  performance. Research in this direction will provide the foundation for  extending the capability of WSNs to more engineering application domains.</p>

<strong>Title</strong>:&nbsp;Identifying  Propagation Sources and Modeling Propagation Dynamics in Networks </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> It has long been a significant but difficult problem to identify propagation sources and model propagation dynamics based on limited knowledge of network structures and the varying states of network nodes. Real cases of identifying propagation sources and modeling propagation dynamics include finding the spreader of malware and propagation process in computer networks, and locating the sources of rumours and propagation dynamics of rumours and truths in online social networks. This talk reviews the state-of-the art in source identification techniques, and discusses the pros and cons of current methods in this field. In order to gain a quantitative understanding of current methods, we provide a series of experiments and comparisons based on various environment settings. We then present our work in modelling the propagation of scanning worms, online social network worms, as well as rumours and truths in online social networks.</p>

<strong>Title</strong>:&nbsp;In-Memory  Computing: New Architecture for Big Data Processing </p>
  <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: With emerging of  big data, the processing speed for the data is one of the key issues for big  data technology. One of the efficient way to handle the velocity of data is  putting all the data in the memory. But traditional memory, DRAM, consumes a  large amount of energy and cost to build a large memory system. In recent  years, lots of non-volatile memory devices, such as phase change memory (PCM),  are studied to be part of memory. We call these storage class memory (SCM).  Combing traditional memory and SCM together to build a large hybrid memory  space is becoming one of the energy-efficient way to extend the traditional  in-memory computing system into a new level, to handle large quality of data in  real time. In this talk, we will discuss this new in-memory computing system  from different aspects and some challenges in this new system. We will also  report some ongoing effort in China to build this hybrid memory-based in-memory  computing system, and some latest advances in this area.</p>

<strong>Title</strong>:&nbsp;Detection of Denial-of-Service Attacks Based on Computer Vision Techniques </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Detection  of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks has attracted researchers since 1990s. A  variety of detection systems has been proposed to achieve this task. Unlike the  existing approaches based on machine learning and statistical analysis, the  proposed system treats traffic records as images and detection of DoS attacks  as a computer vision problem. A multivariate correlation analysis approach is introduced  to accurately depict network traffic records and to convert the records into the  respective images. The images of network traffic records are used as the  observed objects of our proposed DoS attack detection system, which is  developed based on a widely used dissimilarity measure, namely Earth Mover's  Distance (EMD). EMD takes cross-bin matching into account and provides a more  accurate evaluation on the dissimilarity between distributions than some other  well-known dissimilarity measures. These unique merits facilitate our proposed  system with effective detection capabilities. To evaluate the proposed EMD-based  detection system, ten-fold cross-validations are conducted using KDD Cup 99  data set and ISCX 2012 IDS Evaluation data set. The results presented in the  system evaluation section illustrate that our detection system can detect  unknown DoS attacks and achieves 99.95% detection accuracy on KDD Cup 99 data  set and 90.12% detection accuracy on ISCX 2012 IDS evaluation data set with  processing capability of approximately 59,000 traffic records per second.        </p>
