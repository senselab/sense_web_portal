					<strong>Title</strong>: &nbsp;Kicking and Fixing Software: The Fun &amp Science of Experimental Approaches  
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;The perpetual elusiveness of correct-by-design software fosters the need of techniques to "find and fix" software deficiencies whether they arise from design, operational or deliberate instances. Operating Systems are of particular interest given the software size, complexity and their need to operate for a wide range of stresses. With the intent of post-design software fixes, the talk ruminates on the fun, value and science of experimental techniques to "kick n' fix" software.</p>

					<strong>Title</strong>:&nbsp;Software Fault Tolerance via Environmental Diversity 
				</p>
				<p align="justify"> 
					<strong>Abstract</strong>:&nbsp; Complex systems in different domains contain significant amount of software. Several recent studies have established that a significant fraction of system outages are due to software faults. Traditional methods of fault avoidance, fault removal based on extensive testing/debugging, and fault tolerance based on design/data diversity are found wanting. The key challenge then is how to provide highly dependable software. We discuss a new view of fault tolerance of software-based systems. We classify software faults into <i>Bohrbugs</i> and <i>Mandelbugs</i>, and identify aging-related bugs as a subtype of the latter. Traditional methods have been designed to deal with Bohrbugs. The next challenge then is to develop mitigation methods for Mandelbugs in general and aging-related bugs in particular. We submit that mitigation methods for Mandelbugs utilize <i>environmental diversity</i>. Retry operation, restart application, failover to an identical replica (hot, warm or cold) and reboot the OS are examples of mitigation techniques that rely on environmental diversity. For <i>software aging</i> related bugs it is also possible to utilize proactive environmental diversity technique known as <i>software rejuvenation</i>. We discuss environmental diversity both from experimental and analytic points of view and cite examples of real systems employing these techniques.
